# Game Feature and Improvements Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of several enhancements to the ParentShield.AI project:

1. Fixed red text encoding issues in backend files
2. Fixed usage counter double counting issue
3. Added "Back to Dashboard" buttons to all pages
4. Created a new interactive Game Feature to teach fraud detection

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend File Fixes

Fixed encoding issues in:
- `backend/fraud/app.py`
- `backend/transaction_fraud_detection_TEminiproj/pipeline.py`

These files were rewritten to remove any encoding artifacts that were causing red text display issues.

### 2. Usage Tracker Improvements

Enhanced `frontend/src/lib/usageTracker.js` to prevent double counting:
- Added session storage tracking to ensure each feature is only counted once per session
- Added a new `gameFeature` counter
- Improved reset functionality

### 3. "Back to Dashboard" Buttons

Added consistent "Back to Dashboard" navigation links to:
- `frontend/src/pages/MessageFraud.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/TransactionFraud.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/Learninglessons.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/feedback.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/ReportGenerator.jsx`

### 4. New Game Feature

Created a new interactive educational game:
- `frontend/src/pages/GameFeature.jsx` - Main game component
- Added to dashboard as a new card
- Added to routing in `App.jsx`

## Game Feature Details

### Purpose
The Fraud Fighter Game is designed to educate users (especially parents) about fraud detection through interactive scenarios. Players learn to identify fraud attempts by making decisions in realistic situations.

### Game Mechanics
1. **Multiple Levels**: 5 different fraud scenarios
2. **Time Pressure**: 30-second timer per question
3. **Lives System**: 3 lives to encourage learning without frustration
4. **Scoring**: Points awarded for correct answers
5. **Educational Feedback**: Explanations provided for each answer

### Learning Outcomes
Players will learn to:
- Identify phishing attempts
- Recognize lottery and scam messages
- Understand why banks never ask for OTPs via message
- Handle impersonation attempts
- Verify requests through official channels

### Game Scenarios
1. **Bank Account Threat**: "Your account will be closed unless you verify details"
2. **Lottery Scam**: "You've won $5000 in a lottery you never entered"
3. **OTP Request**: "Reply with your OTP to complete transaction"
4. **Tech Support Scam**: "Your computer is infected, allow remote access"
5. **Impersonation**: "Friend stranded abroad needs money urgently"

## Technical Implementation

### Usage Tracking
The usage tracker now uses sessionStorage to prevent double counting:
```javascript
// Check if we've already incremented this feature in the current session
const sessionKey = `parentshield_${feature}_incremented`;
if (sessionStorage.getItem(sessionKey)) {
  // Already incremented in this session, don't increment again
  return currentCount;
}

// Mark that we've incremented this feature in the current session
sessionStorage.setItem(sessionKey, 'true');
```

### Component Structure
Each dashboard card now:
1. Fetches its usage count on mount
2. Displays a badge with the count if > 0
3. Uses appropriate styling for visual consistency

### Game Architecture
The game uses React state management for:
- Game flow (menu, playing, results)
- Question progression
- Score tracking
- Timer management
- Answer validation

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Session-based usage tracking to prevent double counting
- Consistent navigation across all pages
- Responsive game interface
- Educational content based on real fraud scenarios
- Visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

## Future Enhancements
